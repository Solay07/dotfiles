Code for PDFD
=============

Prot's Dots For Debian (PDFD) is the book that guides users through the
process of reproducing my custom BSPWM session on Debian 10 'buster'.

This repo contains the latest "fixed release" of my dotfiles.  Actual
development takes place there: https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles

The purpose of this repo is to provide the stable code base that is used
in PDFD's tutorials.

The book is freely available on my website: https://protesilaos.com/pdfd
